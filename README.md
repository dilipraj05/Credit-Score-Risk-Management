## 🎯 Project Objective

To predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan using historical credit data. This helps financial institutions reduce credit risk and make better lending decisions.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Features**: Age, Monthly Income, Late Payments, Dependents, Revolving Utilization, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (ML models)  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Steps Covered

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Missing value treatment  
   - Outlier handling  
   - Type conversion

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visual insights into income, age, default rates

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new features (e.g., income per dependent, late payment score)

4. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve  
   - Feature Importance

---

## ✅ Results

- **Random Forest** achieved high accuracy with balanced precision/recall
- ROC AUC score > 0.80
- Most important features: Number of late payments, Income, Age, Debt ratio
